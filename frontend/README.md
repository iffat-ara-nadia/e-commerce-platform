# Proshop Commands
To create a boilerplate of our application:

```Either we can install create-react-app in our system globally and then run it
> npm install create-react-app
> create-react-app app_name

```
```Or we can just use the npx command and then run create-react-app without installing
> npx create-react-app app_name
